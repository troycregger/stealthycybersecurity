<h1>Future site of Stealthy CyberSecurity</H1><br>

<p>To beat a black hat hacker, you have to think like a black hat hacker, period. Ethical hackers or  Penetration testers analyze network environments, identify potential vulnerabilities, and try to exploit those vulnerabilities (or coding errors) just like a Cyber criminal would. In simpler terms, they try to break into your company's network to find security holes.</p><br>

<p>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3 requires both an internal and external penetration test (What is PCI?), so most companies regularly receive penetration tests to comply with that requirement. But penetration testing isn't limited to the PCI DSS. Any company can request a penetration test whenever they wish to measure their business security.</p><br> 

<p>Our experience is with startups and similar small companies and organizations, we know their needs and requirement, and we
know that they do not have the budget of the fortune 500 and such. So we keep cost to a minimoun using open source tools, because what matters are not the tools but the talent..</p><br>
